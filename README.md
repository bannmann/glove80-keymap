## Features

- While left shift is held, tapping right shift will send a closing parenthesis. The reverse will send an opening parenthesis.
- `ESC` and `PRINT SCREEN` are protected against accidentally pressing them; if not held for at least 100 ms, these keys do nothing.
- Tap ♾️ to enable layer for next keypress. That keypress will send a predefined WinCompose sequence.
- Tap ♾️ 2x = F24 = start custom WinCompose sequence.

## Notes

- RH T3 intentionally uses LALT instead of RALT as the latter seems to be equivalent to CTRL+ALT and is therefore not suited for making the thumbs fully equal.
